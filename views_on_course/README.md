### My views on *The Unix Workbench*

When I started the course I was aware of Unix/Linux but I didn't had any experience of using it.

The course **The Unix Workbench** by **Sean Kroovs** provided by **John Hopkins University** helped me a lot to get used to Unix.

Before starting the course I was very scared to see the black screen of the Unix as it always reminds me the movie *Matrix* and I had a feeling that Unix is not for me.

Once I started the course and as it get progressed I started loving Unix, it made me comfortable to play in the terminal.

I recommend this course to everyone who is scared of and those who want to learn **Unix/Linux**

### Vote of Thanks

I sincerely thank **Mr.Sean Kroovs** and **Team** for this wonderful course of **The Unix Workbench** which helped me getting comfortable with Unix.


**Regards**
